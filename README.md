## My process
I started with mobile and then switched to desktop once mobile looked alright. I quickly learned it would have been smarter to plan out my use of flexbox originally, rather than using magic numbers to make the mobile design look exactly like the screenshot. But redesigning for desktop also helped the mobile design use less random margins etc and rely more on basic flexbox, which helped it look cleaner on a broader variety of devices.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am definitely going to spend 15 minutes problem solving my flexbox/grid plans before diving into CSS moving forward. This was also my first javascript project, so a lot of very basic things (when to call a function and when to call its result, etc) were figured out in the process.
